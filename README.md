Smart Farmer is a IOT system that turns a normal field into a smart farm. The farm consists of all the necessary IOT devices and sensors. Using technology in farming helps farmers yield more crops and grow more.

The smart farm is comprised of:
- Arduino UNO
- DHT22 Sensor(Reads Sorrounding Temperature and Humidity)
- Soil Moisture Sensor( Reads moisture present in soil)
- Ultrasonic Sensor(Measures Distance(Here used for monitoring trespassers in farm)
- 12V Water Pump
- Relay(To control water pump using Arduino)
- Breadboard
- Jumpers(M2M & F2M)
